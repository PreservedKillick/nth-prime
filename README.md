Epicodus: Week3, Day2 (part 3)

Progress:  Did not get very far in this 3rd exercise of the day.  As it currently reads, the code will start an infinite loop.

****************
Lesson

Let's go in the other direction now. Write a method that takes a number as an argument, and returns the nth prime of that number.

If you don't understand what nth prime means, here's an example. Here are the first eight prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. 19 is the 8th prime. 17 is the 7th prime. Your program should find the nth prime, where n is any number given to it.
